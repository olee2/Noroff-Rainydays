This is a cross-course projects I have been working with during my first year of front-end development studies at Noroff. We started out with prototyping it during the first design course, then building it during our HTML/CSS course and continuing with making it more dynamic using WP and its REST API for content management and, in a later course, adding interactive design principles to make it more engaging for the user.

## Description

We were tasked with building a web site for a science museum that should be informative and appealing. The copy and some of the images were provided by Noroff.
