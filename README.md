# Rainy Days

This is a cross-course projects I have been working with during my first year of front-end development studies at Noroff.

## Description

We were tasked with building a e-commerce site selling rain jackets. We started out with prototyping it during the first design course, then building it during our HTML/CSS course and continuing with making it more dynamic using WP and its REST API for content management and, in a later course, adding interactive design principles to make it more engaging for the user.

Requirements:

- In addition to home, product page, contact and about, the site should have a process from product added to cart until check out
- Responsive
- Quick to download
- Should take WCAG principles into consideration

Due to this being a site that has been developed as I have learned new technologies and principles, there was never a coherent plan. But the site has served its purpose in terms of learning. As I have been coming back to it I always see things that should have been done otherwise, but that I didn't have the skills to see at the time of development.
